# Introduction 
Forests are vital to the global environment, playing essential roles in carbon sequestration, water regulation, and biodiversity preservation. They are also significantly impacted by climate change, which alters the distribution and composition of tree species. In order to understand these shifts, it is crucial to study the factors influencing tree species migration and their spatial diversity. One effective way of investigating these dynamics is through the analysis of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. This data provides a comprehensive look at the distribution of tree species across different regions, allowing researchers to track changes in species composition over time. The goal of this project is to explore how environmental gradients, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil type, influence tree species distribution and how climate change affects their migration trends. By answering these questions, we can enhance our understanding of biogeographic patterns and contribute to the development of sustainable forest management strategies.
# Research Question

How does the temperature gradient influence the abundance and distribution of Quercus rubra across different regions over time, and what are the ecological implications of these changes on forest ecosystems and biodiversity?

# Background

Forests cover about 31% of the Earth's land area, providing vital ecosystem services. Climate change has accelerated in tree species distributions, with many species moving to higher latitudes or elevations in response to warming temperatures (Parmesan, 2006; Iverson et al., 2008). Previous studies have established temperature as a key driver of tree migration, but little research has specifically focused on how Quercus rubra responds to temperature changes across its range. Quercus rubra is a cornerstone species of temperate forests in North America, contributing to ecosystems stability and providing critical habitat and resources. Its response to temperature changes will likely have cascading effects on forest ecosystems. By analyzing FIA data, this study seeks to provide a detailed understanding of Quercus rubraâ€™s relationship with temperature gradients contributing to sustainable forest management and conservation strategies.

# Hypothesis

Regions experiencing warmer temperatures will exhibit a decline in Quercus rubra abundance. Quercus rubra will show a northward migration trend in response to rising temperatures.
